				 In lieu of the notes above, we attempted to observe relationship between income and migration in metropolitan areas in the United States using migration and income data between 2013 and 2017 from the U.S. Census. Not seeing as large of an association as we expected, we decided to modify our objectives. 
				 In addition to visualizing migration data, we wanted to explore reasons why specific metropolitan areas either diverged from or followed our hypothesis, highlighting interesting historical and economic events around outliers. <br> Scroll down to explore!

					<p>For each metropolitan area, the figure to the right plots the <b>relationship</b> between the <b>net population change ratio</b> (net number of individuals who migrated to or from the area divided by the total population) and <b>real personal income</b> (RPI, which is normalized in light of inflation), between 2013 and 2017. As you can probably perceive, there is <b>no clear relationship between the two.</b> However, we’ve identified <b>three outlier groups </b>, which are circled in <b>red!</b></p>
