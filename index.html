				“In the United States, among the important forces in the convergence of per capita income levels ... has been the inter-regional migration of persons.”

				“Advanced and expanding regions are usually the receiving regions for  internal migration.”
			</p>			
			<p class='intro__text'>
				 In our mission to observe the relationship between income and migration in metropolitan areas in the United States, we had two objectives. Our first objective was to visualize these migrations. Our second was to explore reasons why specific metropolitan areas either diverged from or followed our hypothesis.

					<p>For each metropolitan area, the figure to the right plots the <b>relationship</b> between the <b>net population change ratio</b> (net number of individuals who migrated to or from the area divided by the total population) and <b>real personal income</b> (RPI, which is normalized in light of inflation), between 2013 and 2017. As you can probably perceive, there is <b>no clear relationship between the two.</b> However, we’ve identified <b>outliers</b>, which are circled in <b>dotted lines!</b></p>
